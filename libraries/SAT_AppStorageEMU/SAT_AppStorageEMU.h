    Description :  emulator class adapted from the SAT_AppStorage class made by NanoSatisfi for ArduSat
                   outputs the values to Serial instead of communicating them via I2C
                   
    Usage :        - same as SAT_AppStorage
                   - option : modify debugMode -> true to output the message to Serial
