ardusat_sysico
==============

This code is dedicated to the experiments developed for ArduSat by the SYSICO education program (SYSICO stands for "Information and Knowledge Systems") of Arts et Métiers ParisTech.

Considering the ArduSat platform, our objective is just to gather as much sensor values as possible in order to build an open source database of sensor values. This database will be used by teachers and students of Arts et Métiers ParisTech in order to build pedagogical experiments of their own.
